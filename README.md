# Packet_Sniffing_and_Spoofing

## Sniffer.py : 
Write your own sniffer for capturing packets.  Your sniffer should be able to sniff the following protocols:
-	TCP
-	UDP 
-	ICMP
-	IGMP
-	RAW (other - default)
Run your Ex 2 from Networks Course. Use your sniffer to sniff the TCP packets and write them out into a txt file named after your IDs. The format of each packet should be { source_ip: <input>, dest_ip: <input>, source_port: <input>, dest_port: <input>, timestamp: <input>, total_length: <input>, cache_flag: <input>, steps_flag: <input>, type_flag: <input>, status_code: <input>, cache_control: <input>, data: <input> }
The data output may be unreadable in ASCII form so write the output as hexadecimal.
